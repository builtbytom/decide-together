# DecideTogether

End the "what's for dinner?" debate forever. A couples decision-making app that uses AI to find the perfect compromise when you can't agree.

## Problem We Solve
- Couples waste 5+ days per year deciding what to eat
- 156 arguments annually about dinner decisions
- Decision fatigue leads to expensive takeout habits

## How It Works
1. Both partners swipe on meal options
2. Instant match = problem solved!
3. No match? AI suggests the perfect compromise
4. Learn your preferences over time
